# AGENTS.md — Quock

Single source of truth for any AI coding agent operating on this repository (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Gemini, Aider, Continue, …). `CLAUDE.md` is a 1-line shim that points here. Slash command procedures live in `.agent/commands/{commit,pr,code-review}.md` and read this file at the start of every iteration.

---

## Project

Quock is a community-built mobile client for **Ollama Cloud**. React Native + Expo, iOS + Android. The user signs in with an `ollama.com` account, picks a cloud-hosted model, and chats with streaming responses. Conversations persist locally in SQLite — the cloud only sees the message currently in flight.

Quock is **not affiliated with Ollama, Inc.** It is an unofficial third-party client, distributed under MIT with the original Ollama copyright preserved.

**Design north star**: open the app → tap a model → type → streamed response, in under three taps from home.

---

## Reading order (mandatory, every task)

Working memory is not persistent across tasks. Re-read at the start of every iteration:

1. This file end-to-end.
2. The file the task touches end-to-end, plus its immediate consumers (`grep -rn "SymbolName"`).
3. The slash command procedure when invoking `/commit`, `/pr`, or `/review` — `.agent/commands/{commit,pr,code-review}.md`.

When a rule is missing, contradictory, or silent on the exact question, surface the gap and ask the human. Do not guess.

---

## Quick start prompt

Copy-paste into any AI dev tool to onboard it:

```
You are the sequential AI dev for Quock, an unofficial React Native + Expo client for Ollama Cloud.

Rules:
1. Read AGENTS.md end-to-end before writing code.
2. Branch from `develop`, never from `main`. One feature → one branch → multi-commit → one PR into `develop` → STOP, wait for human merge.
3. Run /review (.agent/commands/code-review.md) before /pr — it is iterative and resets after every fix.
4. Add the assisting AI tool's `Co-Authored-By` trailer to commits it makes (and its attribution footer to PR bodies) — AI-authored work must stay traceable.
5. English in code, commits, PR bodies. Italian / other languages are fine in conversation only.
```

## The 5 non-negotiables

1. **Brand neutrality.** App, README, LICENSE, and About screen state that Quock is not affiliated with Ollama, Inc. The Ollama logo and mascot are never used inside Quock.
2. **MIT dual copyright preserved.** `LICENSE` keeps `Copyright (c) 2026 Matteo Celani` first and `Copyright (c) Ollama` second — never remove the Ollama line.
3. **Cloud-only inference.** The model runs on `ollama.com` — never on the device, never on a paired host; if a feature requires a local runtime, it does not ship. No localhost discovery, no paired-desktop daemon, nothing that assumes a local `ollama`. Every `ollama.com` route is fair game — including `/api/tags`, which on that host is the cloud's own catalogue, not a local install list. Quock's direct endpoint is `ollama.com` by default; an **opt-in self-hosted Open WebUI sync gateway** (see §"Self-hosted connection (Open WebUI)") may sit in front of `ollama.com` for chat persistence and cross-device sync — it runs no model and is reached by a base URL the user types in, never auto-discovered, so it is not a local runtime.
4. **Ed25519 device keypair auth (Ollama Cloud mode).** In the default mode every API call to `ollama.com` is signed via `signRequest()` in `src/modules/auth/lib/sign.ts`; the seed lives in `expo-secure-store` only. No OAuth, password, cookie, or JWT in this mode. The **self-hosted Open WebUI mode** (see §"Self-hosted connection (Open WebUI)") authenticates to the gateway with a bearer token (an Open WebUI API key or a sign-in JWT) — the one permitted exception. The Ed25519 keypair is still generated and stored in `expo-secure-store` in that mode; it is unused while the gateway is the endpoint.
5. **The design system is owned in-repo.** No external design or UI libraries — every surface, primitive, and motion in Quock is built from `GlassOrb`, `Sheet`, `Button`, `Pressable`, the design tokens in `src/lib/design/`, and the Tailwind theme. Any new npm package requires explicit approval; justify it in the PR description.

## Tech stack (locked)

Expo SDK 55 (New Architecture, Fabric, TurboModules) · React 19 + React Native 0.83.6 · Expo Router · NativeWind v4 + Tailwind v3 · TanStack Query 5 · react-native-reanimated 4 + react-native-worklets · `@shopify/flash-list` · `expo-sqlite` · `expo-secure-store` · `react-native-mmkv` · `expo/fetch` (streaming) · `tweetnacl` (Ed25519) · `expo-blur` · `expo-linear-gradient` + `@react-native-masked-view/masked-view` (gradient blur masks behind the floating header / composer) · `zustand` 5 · `react-native-keyboard-controller` · `react-native-gesture-handler` v2.

**Banned (categorical)**: any third-party design / UI / component library (we own the design system) · Redux · Jotai · Recoil · axios · moment / dayjs (use `Intl.*`) · `@gorhom/bottom-sheet` (fails silently on iOS Fabric — we use our own `<Sheet>`) · native `<FlatList>` for messages · RN `Animated.*` legacy · `<TouchableOpacity>` (use `<Pressable>`).

## Getting started

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm install` | Install dependencies |
| `pnpm start` | Metro bundler |
| `pnpm ios` | Build + open iOS simulator |
| `pnpm android` | Build + open Android emulator |
| `pnpm prebuild` | Regenerate native `ios/` + `android/` projects |
| `pnpm typecheck` · `pnpm lint` · `pnpm test` | Build gate (see below) |

> **First run.** Needs **pnpm 11+** — Metro's hoist settings live in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (not `.npmrc`, which pnpm 11 ignores).
> **On a physical device**, enable iOS **Developer Mode** (Settings → Privacy & Security) or Android **USB debugging** (Developer options) first, then `pnpm ios --device` / `pnpm android --device` — otherwise the app installs but won't launch.

**When the build breaks**, run in order: `pnpm start --reset-cache`, then `watchman watch-del-all && rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/*`, then `cd ios && bundle exec pod install`.

## Repository structure

```
app/                      Expo Router routes (repo ROOT, not src/) — every file is a route, no components.
codegen/                  Generated Go type mirror (gotypes.gen.ts), imported as @/gotypes. Never hand-edit.
assets/                   Static app resources (app.json icons, splash, doc PDFs). In-app SVG icons live in src/assets/icons/.
src/
  modules/<feature>/      Feature business logic: hooks/, stores/, api/, lib/, context/, types.ts, constants.ts.
  components/             UI only — ui/ (primitives), <feature>/ (feature UI), layout/, global/.
  lib/                    Infra shared by 2+ modules: api/, db/, design/, contexts/, theme/, stores/, hooks/, constants/, types/.
```

Features today: `chat`, `auth`, `models`, `settings`.

**Placement rule.** Used by 2+ modules → `src/lib/` (or `components/ui/` for a primitive). Used by one module → inside that module. Used by one file → named constant at top of that file. When a module-local unit gets a second consumer, promote it in the same PR.

**Threshold rule.** 1 item → flat file (`hooks.ts`, `types.ts`). 2+ items → folder (`hooks/`, `types/`). No empty folders. No stub files "for the future" — the structure grows as features land, not in anticipation.

## How to add things

| Task | Pattern |
| --- | --- |
| New feature | `src/modules/<feature>/` (logic) + `src/components/<feature>/` (UI). Never scatter across the tree. |
| New server-state hook | `src/modules/<feature>/hooks/use<X>.ts`. Use `queryKeys.<x>(…)` from `@/lib/hooks/queryKeys`, never inline arrays. Components consume the hook — never call `useQuery` directly. |
| New repository method | Extend the relevant file in `src/lib/db/`. SQLite repos are native-module surfaces covered by Maestro E2E on device (see §Testing), not a Jest test; add a unit test only for any pure helper extracted alongside. |
| New sheet | Compose `<Sheet>` + `<SheetHeader>`. Mount unconditionally as a sibling of chat home; visibility is a prop, not a conditional render. |
| Dialog centered against the display, not the sheet | Pass it via the `overlays` slot of `<Sheet>` — otherwise an `absolute inset-0` dialog centers against the sheet body. |
| Labeled CTA (Cancel, Confirm, Sign Out, Upgrade, …) | `<Button>` with the matching variant. Never compose raw `<Pressable bg-X rounded-full>`. |
| Icon-only floating button | `<GlassOrb interactive>` with `borderRadius={999}`. |
| New magic number | Module-local → `src/modules/<feature>/constants.ts`. Shared by 2+ modules → `src/lib/constants/magic-numbers.ts`. Never inline. |
| New design value (color, spacing, motion) | Extend one of the three design files (`colors.cjs`, `tailwind.config.js`, `tokens.ts`). Never inline at the use-site. |

## Code rules

### TypeScript

- No `any`. Use `unknown` + type guard if a type is truly unknown.
- Explicit return types on every exported function, hook, component.
- `interface` for object shapes (props, API payloads, entities); `type` for unions, intersections, branded, derived.
- Branded IDs from `src/lib/types/ids.ts` (`ChatId`, `MessageId`, `AttachmentId`) — never raw `number` / `string`. Brand via `asChatId()`, `asMessageId()`.
- `as const` for fixed configuration arrays and objects.
- Never mutate state, props, arrays, or objects in place — spread, `map`, `filter`.

### Imports & paths

- All imports use absolute `@/*` paths, including same-folder. Zero relative imports outside auto-generated code.
- No barrel `index.ts` files. Import directly from the source file.
- Never invent or import packages not in `package.json`.
- Import order: external packages → `@/gotypes` → `@/*`. No blank lines between groups.

### Comments

- English only.
- 1-2 lines max per comment.
- Explain WHY, not WHAT.
- Prohibited: bullets, numbered lists, `-`/`*` list markers, decorative dividers (`// ── XYZ ──`), ASCII art, multi-paragraph blocks. Em-dash punctuation (`X — Y`) in prose is fine.
- Default to no comment unless the WHY is non-obvious.

### Naming

- Components `PascalCase`. Hooks `camelCase` starting with `use`. Utilities `camelCase`. Constants `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`. Type aliases `PascalCase`.
- Booleans prefix `is`, `has`, `should`, or `can`.

### Styling (NativeWind v4)

- NativeWind classes for layout, color, spacing, typography. Inline `style={{}}` only for `useAnimatedStyle` results or measured numeric values.
- No arbitrary Tailwind values (`w-[50px]`, `text-[13px]`, `bg-[#xxx]`). Use the scale or extend `tailwind.config.js`.
- Semantic color classes (`bg-card`, `text-muted-foreground`) or `useThemeColors()` — never palette accessors (`gray2`), never inline hex.
- `clsx` for dynamic class merges — never template strings.
- **Tailwind-first scale.** Use stock Tailwind classes for fonts, spacing, tracking, radii. Never redefine a stock name with a different value, and never add a custom tier that's a synonym for a value a stock class already renders. NativeWind inlines `rem` at **14px** here (metro default, not overridden), so a stock class renders at 0.875× its web px — e.g. `text-xs` = 10.5px, `rounded-lg` = 7px. A custom px tier is allowed only where stock genuinely lacks a step a layout needs (e.g. `p-4.5` = 18px). `tokens.ts` holds only axes Tailwind can't express (icons, shadows, z-layers, motion, per-component layout) — one home per value, no synonyms.

### Components & React

- Named exports everywhere except Expo Router files (`app/_layout.tsx`, `app/index.tsx`, `app/[route].tsx`).
- `React.memo` wrapped: `export const X = React.memo(...)`. Never `export default React.memo(...)`.
- No `React.FC` / `React.FunctionComponent`. Type props directly.
- Hooks consuming React Context throw a clear error outside their Provider.
- Component file size: indicative ≤ 300 lines. Split only on a clean logical seam.

### Animations (Reanimated 4)

- Reanimated 4 worklets only. No RN `Animated.*` legacy.
- Spring configs from `src/lib/design/motion.ts` (`pressSpring`, `surfaceSpring`, `toggleSpring`, `sheetSpring`). Never hand-roll damping / stiffness.
- `useAnimatedStyle` results only on `Animated.*` components — never on `<View>` / `<Text>`.
- `useSharedValue` for JS-side values consumed by worklets — never closure capture.

### State

State is chosen by **persistence** and **scope**. Pick the bucket from the table — never duplicate the same piece of state across two buckets.

| Bucket | Tool | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Server state | TanStack Query, via `src/modules/<feature>/hooks/` | Anything originating from `ollama.com` (chats, messages, models, capabilities). Never `useQuery` / `useMutation` in components. Keys via `queryKeys.*` factory. |
| Volatile UI state | Zustand, one store per domain | Streaming chunks, sheet visibility, toast queue. Global in `src/lib/stores/`, feature in `src/modules/<feature>/stores/`. Never a mega-store. |
| Persistent prefs | Zustand + `persist` middleware (MMKV) | Theme, default model, haptics. `src/lib/stores/settings.store.ts`. Volatile stores never persist. |
| Persistent data | SQLite via repositories in `src/lib/db/` | Chat rows, message rows, attachments. No SQL outside repositories. |
| DI singletons | React Context (`ApiContext`, `DbContext`, `AuthContext`) | Wrap instances, not state. |
| Ephemeral | `useState` | Draft text, open / close, hover, focus. |

**State anti-patterns** (refuse on review):

- Duplicating server data in `useState` or Zustand — the cache is truth, refetch on mutation.
- Mirroring a TanStack Query cache into Zustand — use a TQ `select` or a custom hook.
- Global Context for ephemeral UI state — `useState` is the answer.
- Scattered `isLoading` / `isError` / `data` shadowing TanStack Query's own status fields.
- `useReducer` for simple toggles — `useState`.

### Zustand discipline

- Never `useXStore()` without a selector — whole-store subscriptions cause re-render storms.
- Object selectors require `useShallow` from `zustand/react/shallow`.
- Actions live inside the store. Never mutate via `set` from outside the store file.
- Never mirror a TanStack Query cache into Zustand. Use a TQ `select` or a custom hook instead.
- MMKV adapter only stores plain JSON-serializable values. Never persist React refs, functions, or SQLite rows.

### API & data access

- Components never call `fetch` directly. Go through `@/lib/api/client.ts` + `src/modules/<feature>/api/`.
- Use `expo/fetch` for streaming — global `fetch` has `response.body === null` on iOS.
- All API errors flow through `CloudAPIError` in `@/lib/api/errors`.
- Components never open SQLite directly — use a repository.
- Components never read SecureStore or MMKV directly — wrap in a hook (`useAuth`, `useSettingsStore`, …).

### Hook naming

Server-state hooks in `src/modules/<feature>/hooks/` follow a semantic prefix so a reader knows the lifecycle at a glance:

| Prefix | Meaning | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `useGet*` | Single fetch | `useGetChat(id)` |
| `useList*` | List / paginated fetch | `useListChats()` |
| `useInfinite*` | Infinite scroll | `useInfiniteMessages(chatId)` |
| `useCreate*` | Create mutation | `useCreateChat()` |
| `useUpdate*` | Update mutation | `useUpdateChatTitle(id)` |
| `useDelete*` | Delete mutation | `useDeleteChat(id)` |
| `useSend*` | Streaming / fire-and-forget action | `useSendMessage(chatId)` |
| `usePrefetch*` | Hover / intent prefetch | `usePrefetchChat(id)` |

Non-server hooks (theme, haptics, keyboard state) keep plain `useX` names.

### Errors & logging

- Never swallow errors silently. `try { } catch (e) {}` is prohibited.
- Re-throw with cause preserved: `throw new Error("Action failed", { cause: error });`.
- Surface user-facing failures via `Toast` / `Banner` primitives OR the `status: 'error'` lifecycle on the message row.
- No `console.log`. Allowed: `console.error`, `console.warn`, `console.info`.
- Production catch blocks use `console.warn` (not `error`) so RN's dev LogBox does not fullscreen on expected mock failures.
- `__DEV__`-gated API trace logs (`[API] →`, `[API] ←`) carry the marker comment `// Debug trace log — remove before release.` so they can be greppable for v1.0.

### Magic numbers

- All durations, thresholds, throttle intervals, retry counts, status codes, byte sizes, animation timings → a `constants.ts`. Never inline.
- Module-local → `src/modules/<feature>/constants.ts`. Shared by 2+ modules → `src/lib/constants/magic-numbers.ts`.
- Not magic numbers: Tailwind utility values (`w-12`, `gap-2`), SVG attributes (`viewBox`, `cx`, `strokeWidth`, `d`), trivial 0 / 1 in boolean expressions, `padStart(2, "0")`.

### Sheets & modals

- `<Sheet>` from `@/components/ui/Sheet` is the only sheet primitive. Never `@gorhom/bottom-sheet`.
- `<SheetHeader>` for the header row (title + optional left/right slots, 44pt height). All sheets consume it for visual unity.
- The 4 sheets (`AccountSheet`, `ChatHistorySheet`, `ModelPickerSheet`, `AttachSheet`) render unconditionally as siblings of chat home — visibility is a prop, not a conditional render.
- Dialogs centered against the display use the `overlays` slot of `<Sheet>`.

### Lists

- `@shopify/flash-list` with stable `keyExtractor`, `estimatedItemSize`, `getItemType` for mixed-row lists.
- Never `FlatList` for messages — performance degrades above ~50 rows.
- Auto-scroll only when the user is at the tail (see `isAtBottomRef` pattern in `MessageList.tsx`).

### Images

- `expo-image` only. Never RN `<Image>`.
- Attachment thumbs: prefer `uri` from `DbAttachment`; otherwise build a `data:` URI via `bytesToDataUri()` (memoized per chip).
- Static assets via `require("@/assets/images/...")`.

### Streaming chat

- Endpoint `/api/chat` on `ollama.com`. Never `/api/v1/chat/:id` (that is the desktop app's proprietary endpoint).
- JSONL parsing via `parseJsonlFromResponse` from `@/modules/chat/api/jsonl`.
- Message lifecycle: `pending` → `streaming` → `complete` | `error` | `interrupted`. The `status` column is the source of truth. Never smuggle state inside `content`.
- Retry mutates the same row id — never delete + recreate.
- **Thinking is opt-in; the `think` flag is omitted unless forced.** It rides as `think: true` only when the user has turned thinking on for the chat (a sticky per-chat toggle in the + hub) AND the model is thinking-capable; otherwise the flag is absent and the server applies the model's own default (thinking-capable models reason, others don't), so the user never has to manage it. `think: true` 400s on a non-thinking model, so the toggle is capability-gated. Detection being unreliable (`/api/show` sometimes omits `thinking` for a model that reasons, e.g. minimax-m3) is fine here: omitting lets such a model fall back to its own reasoning default rather than being suppressed.

### Markdown rendering (LLM-defensive)

The parser at `src/components/ui/markdown/parseMarkdown.ts` is intentionally permissive about malformed LLM output:

- Both `- ` and `* ` are valid bullet markers (CommonMark; LLMs emit either).
- Whitespace-only inline code spans are skipped (orphan backticks would otherwise render as empty chips).
- Paragraph source is sanitised before inline parsing: runs of 2+ backticks are stripped (LLM-emitted noise), whitespace is collapsed.
- CommonMark-style emphasis: the `*` / `**` marker must hug non-whitespace on both sides, otherwise the asterisks stay as literal text.

### Testing

- Jest with `jest-expo`. React Native Testing Library for components. Maestro for E2E in `e2e/`.
- Tests co-located: `chat.ts` + `chat.test.ts`.
- Unit tests focus on logic that breaks silently in production: signing, wire shapes, streaming parsers, LLM-defensive markdown. Native-module surfaces (SQLite repositories, expo-image-picker) are covered by Maestro E2E on device, not Jest.
- Tests gated by native modules use `__mocks__/*.ts` shims. New native deps need a matching mock.
- No coverage thresholds — `pnpm test` passing is the gate. Avoid writing tests just to lift a percentage.

### Surgical edits

- Touch only the lines the task requires. Never rename what was not asked. Never reformat untouched code.
- Never use placeholders like `// ... existing code ...`. Always return complete functional code.
- English in code, comments, UI source strings, commit messages, and PR bodies. Italian / other languages stay in conversation and design notes — never in code.

## Self-hosted connection (Open WebUI)

An opt-in alternate mode where Quock talks to a self-hosted Open WebUI instance that **fronts `ollama.com`** for chat persistence and cross-device sync. The model still runs on `ollama.com`; the gateway runs no model. The non-negotiables above (#3, #4) carry the carve-outs that permit it; this section is the binding rules, and a separate design spec holds the full plan.

- **Opt-in, default off.** `connectionMode: 'ollama-cloud' | 'open-webui'` lives in `src/lib/stores/settings.store.ts` (Zustand + MMKV `persist`). The default is `'ollama-cloud'`; the existing Ollama Cloud experience is untouched.
- **Manual endpoint, never discovered.** The user types the Open WebUI base URL (LAN IP or Tailscale IP) in Settings — no mDNS, no scan, no probing. This is what keeps non-negotiable #3's "no localhost discovery" intact.
- **Bearer auth to the gateway, Ed25519 dormant.** The Open WebUI client authenticates with an `Authorization: Bearer` token (an Open WebUI API key preferred, or a sign-in JWT) stored in `expo-secure-store` under a separate namespace. The Ed25519 keypair is still generated and stored; it is unused in this mode. The only permitted exception to #4's "no JWT" — and only for the gateway, never for `ollama.com`.
- **Gateway fronts `ollama.com`; no local inference.** Open WebUI is configured (by the user, in its own admin) to reach `ollama.com`. Quock never assumes a local `ollama` daemon and never calls raw Ollama `/api/tags`; it calls the gateway's OpenAI-compatible `/api/chat/completions` and `/api/models`. A gateway that runs a model locally is out of scope — that would re-trigger #3.
- **Server-side persistence, local mirror.** Open WebUI is the source of truth for chat history; Quock's SQLite becomes a mirror. Reconciliation is additive only (upsert by remote id, soft-delete tombstones) — no destructive DB ops. The existing `pending → streaming → complete` message lifecycle and the `status` column stay the source of truth.
- **Backend abstraction, not a fork.** A `Backend` interface (`src/lib/api/backend.ts`) with two impls — `CloudBackend` (existing, Ed25519) and `OpenWebUiBackend` (new, bearer) — is introduced as a no-behavior-change refactor first; the chat/models hooks select the impl by `connectionMode`. The "components never call `fetch` / `useQuery` directly" rules hold for both modes.
- **Streaming via the existing pipeline.** Open WebUI's SSE (`data: {json}\n\n`, terminated by `[DONE]`) is parsed by a hand-rolled pure helper (`src/modules/chat/lib/sseStream.ts`, unit-tested) and fed into the existing `streamPipeline.ts`. No new SSE dependency; `expo/fetch` stays the transport.
- **Disclosure.** The Connection screen states that chats in this mode are stored on the user's Open WebUI server (not just on-device) and that Open WebUI is a third-party project Quock is not affiliated with (mirrors non-negotiable #1's spirit).

## Design system

The design source lives in three files. Components consume from them — never invent at the use-site.

- `src/lib/design/colors.cjs` — Apple HIG palette + shadcn semantic layer (background, foreground, card, primary, secondary, muted, destructive, destructive-soft, border, ring).
- `tailwind.config.js` — HIG type ramp, named spacing, radii, tracking presets.
- `src/lib/design/tokens.ts` — numeric tokens (icon size, stroke width, motion timings, component layout, opacity tiers, shadow profiles, sheet primitive thresholds).

**Layering**: body = gray6, cards = white, separators = gray4 (iOS Settings pattern, mandatory).

### Surface primitives

One surface primitive (`<GlassOrb>`) plus the labeled `<Button>`. A 5-layer real-glass recipe (BlurView + specular + edge highlights) was prototyped and abandoned — it only read as glass over scrolling content; over opaque sheet bodies it degraded into fake 3D embossing that broke uniformity. The orb is now solid.

- `<GlassOrb>` — pill-shape solid orb with theme-aware tint, soft shadow, press feedback. Used for icon-only floating controls, filter chips, swipe actions, tile cards. Props: `variant: 'clear' | 'regular' | 'thick'`, `interactive`, `disabled`, `tintColor`, `borderRadius`.
- `<Button>` — labeled CTAs. Variants: `primary`, `secondary`, `ghost`, `destructive`, `destructiveSoft` (Apple HIG iOS Settings Sign-Out pattern). Sizes: `sm` / `md` / `lg`.

### Shape language

Apple HIG iOS 26 uses pill shape (`rounded-full`) across the system. Quock follows the same rule everywhere — labeled CTAs and icon orbs share one corner. The single exception is AttachSheet's tile cards (18pt custom radius for the share-sheet aesthetic).

### Layout paradigm (Apple HIG iOS 26)

- **Header dissolved.** Three independent `<GlassOrb>` floating on a `pointerEvents="box-none"` container — no monolithic bar. A `MaskedView` + `LinearGradient` mask paints a soft blur over the safe-area-top, fading to 0% exactly at the orb seam. See `src/components/layout/FloatingHeader.tsx`.
- **Composer floats.** Attach / think / send buttons are `<GlassOrb>` floating over the bare background; the `TextField` is a solid `bg-card` pill in the middle. Same MaskedView gradient blur paints the safe-area-bottom, fading to 0% at the top of the orbs.
- **Sheets are full-width slabs.** Span the display, only top corners rounded (28pt). Body is opaque `bg-card`.
- **Solid CTAs stay solid.** `<Button>` for labeled actions — never compose raw `<Pressable bg-X rounded-full>`.

---

## Platform notes (Fabric iOS 26)

Workarounds for known New-Architecture quirks. Apply categorically:

- **`<TextField>` single-line** — set `height: 44` via the `style` prop (not `className`); Fabric's intrinsic content size is unreliable for a fixed-height row. **Multi-line** — use `minHeight: oneLineHeight` + `maxHeight: maxLines * lineHeight` via `style` and let RN auto-grow inside; manual `onContentSizeChange` tracking jittered on Fabric iOS 26 and was abandoned.
- **`flex-1 aspect-square` in a `flex-row`** — collapses to height 0. Set explicit `width` and `height` instead.
- **`Modal` is a separate UIWindow.** Nest `<GestureHandlerRootView>` inside the `<Modal>`, not outside, or gestures will not register inside the modal.
- **Press tint vs scale** — when a `Pressable` overlay paints a tint and the inner view also scales, the edges of the scaled child diverge from the outer. When both are active, lock `scale = 1`.
- **`@gorhom/bottom-sheet`** — fails silently on Fabric. Use `<Sheet>`.

---

## Environment & secrets

Quock has no runtime `.env` — the device Ed25519 seed is generated on first launch and lives in `expo-secure-store`, never on disk in plain form. **Never paste tokens, API keys, or seed material in chat, commits, logs, or screenshots** — redact in summaries.

## Files not to edit

- `node_modules/`, `ios/Pods/`, `ios/build/`, `android/build/` — build artifacts.
- `codegen/gotypes.gen.ts` (imported as `@/gotypes`) — regenerated from the Go backend; touching it manually breaks the next codegen run.
- `LICENSE` — touch is a STOP signal (see below).
- Compiled locale catalogs — edit the source, not the output.

## STOP signals (announce and wait for human)

- Need to add a new npm package.
- Need to change `app.json` identity (name, slug, scheme, bundleId).
- Need to break an existing public API surface (component prop, hook signature).
- Need to introduce a new top-level folder under `src/` (a new `src/modules/<feature>/` is fine; a new sibling of `modules`/`components`/`lib`/`dev` is a STOP).
- Need to skip a `magic-numbers.ts` constraint (inline magic value).
- A migration adds a destructive DB operation (DROP COLUMN, DELETE FROM, …).
- Tests fail and the fix would require disabling a rule rather than fixing the cause.
- The change touches `LICENSE` text.
- `/review` has run 3 iterations and still finds violations the loop cannot auto-fix.
- AGENTS.md is silent, contradictory, or out-of-date on the exact question — surface the gap, do not guess.

## When the docs and the code disagree

The docs are the contract. If a rule in AGENTS.md no longer matches reality:

1. Stop. Do not silently follow the code over the docs (or vice versa) — both will drift.
2. Surface the gap to the human with a one-line summary of what conflicts.
3. If the rule needs to change, the **docs PR lands first** (small, isolated to AGENTS.md). Then the code PR refers to the new rule.
4. Never develop against an obsolete rule. The cost of a one-day docs PR is lower than the cost of a feature built on a rule that turned out to be stale.

## Workflow

**One feature → one branch from `develop` → multi-commit → one PR into `develop` → STOP → human merges → next task.**

`develop` is the integration branch. `main` is release-only — never push to `main` directly, never target `main` with a PR.

### Workflow principles

1. **Sequential, never parallel.** One feature at a time, one branch at a time, one PR at a time. Parallel work guarantees spaghetti and rule loss.
2. **Mandatory self-review.** `/review` runs before every PR and loops until clean.
3. **Stop at PR ready.** Once the PR is open, stop and wait for the human to merge. Only after merge do you move to the next task.
4. **Trust the docs.** When in doubt, re-read AGENTS.md before inventing — existing rule beats improvisation.

### Branch naming

| Prefix | Use for | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `feat/` | New feature or feature-shaping change | `feat/liquid-glass`, `feat/account-sheet` |
| `fix/` | Bug fix | `fix/sheet-grabber-velocity`, `fix/markdown-empty-chips` |
| `chore/` | Maintenance, deps, config, tooling | `chore/deps-reanimated-4-3`, `chore/agents-rewrite` |
| `docs/` | Docs-only change | `docs/onboarding` |
| `refactor/` | Refactor without new feature or fix | `refactor/sheet-primitive` |
| `release/X.Y.Z` | Release line cut from `develop` (or from `main` for a patch to the live version). Absorbs store review; fixes land here and are cherry-picked back to `develop`. | `release/0.1.2` |

Branch names are kebab-case, descriptive, no ticket numbers (Quock has no tracker in repo).

### Commit pattern

Incremental, never one mega-commit. Aim for 3-7 commits per task, each commit a logical step a reviewer can follow without re-reading the diff back-and-forth. One commit = one concern. When unrelated changes pile up locally, split before pushing.

### Anti-patterns

Cross-cutting workflow don'ts that apply to every command:

- Working on 2 features in parallel — sequential principle, one branch and one PR at a time.
- Mixing doc and code in the same PR — when a rule in AGENTS.md needs to change, the docs PR lands first, then the code PR refers to it.
- Inventing scope when in doubt — ask the human.

Command-specific anti-patterns (force-push, mega-commit, English-only, merge own PR, target main, …) live in the NEVER lists of each `.agent/commands/*.md` — those files are canonical for their procedure.

## Versioning & releases

Quock follows **SemVer** (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`). A released version is a git **tag** (`vX.Y.Z`), not a branch — that keeps the flow linear. `develop` is the trunk where all work lands and never freezes; a `release/X.Y.Z` branch is cut from it to ship one version and absorbs the slow, async store review while `develop` keeps moving; `main` is only a marker of what is currently live, advanced on approval.

The full flow — branch model, when the version bump happens (first step of a release, on `develop`), cherry-picking review fixes back to `develop`, and the store-review cases — lives in [`.agent/commands/release.md`](.agent/commands/release.md). Read it when starting a release.

---

## Slash commands

Procedures live in `.agent/commands/`. Each is an iterative loop: read AGENTS.md, check the diff, fix violations, restart. The cycle closes only when a clean pass produces zero violations.

| Command | Purpose | Rule file |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/commit` | Stage + diff + Conventional Commit + push | `.agent/commands/commit.md` |
| `/pr` | Run `/review` + rebase on `develop` + push + `gh pr create` | `.agent/commands/pr.md` |
| `/review` | Self-review + adversarial panel (independent critics + skeptic verify per finding) + auto-fix loop | `.agent/commands/code-review.md` |
| `/release-start X.Y.Z` | Bump version on `develop`, cut `release/X.Y.Z`, build + submit; tag on approval | `.agent/commands/release.md` |
| `/cleanup` (post-merge) | Checkout `develop`, pull, prune local branch | inline in `.agent/commands/pr.md` |

Conventional Commit `type`s and `scope`s are listed in `.agent/commands/commit.md` — that file is canonical, do not duplicate here. Each command's NEVER list (in its own `.md`) is the canonical reminder of procedure-specific rules; the AI-attribution policy (always co-author AI-made commits/PRs) lives in each command's write step.

## Build gate (zero tolerance)

```
pnpm typecheck    → 0 errors
pnpm lint         → 0 errors, 0 new warnings
pnpm test         → all passing
```

`.github/workflows/mobile-ci.yml` runs the same three commands on every PR into `develop`. PRs cannot merge on red CI.
